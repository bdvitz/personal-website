## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Approach

We can solve this problem using a hash table (object in JavaScript) to store the numbers we've seen so far along with their indices.

**Algorithm:**
1. Create an empty hash table
2. Iterate through the array
3. For each number, check if `target - number` exists in the hash table
4. If it exists, return the current index and the stored index
5. Otherwise, store the current number and its index in the hash table

## Solution

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
    const map = new Map();

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const complement = target - nums[i];

        if (map.has(complement)) {
            return [map.get(complement), i];
        }

        map.set(nums[i], i);
    }

    return [];
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the array once, and hash table lookups are O(1)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - In the worst case, we store all elements in the hash table

## Example

```javascript
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
console.log(twoSum([3, 2, 4], 6));      // Output: [1, 2]
```

## Key Insights

- Using a hash table allows us to achieve O(n) time complexity
- We only need one pass through the array
- The complement pattern (`target - current`) is useful in many array problems
