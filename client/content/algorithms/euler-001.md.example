## Problem Statement

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Mathematical Approach

Instead of iterating through all numbers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence.

The sum of multiples of `n` below `limit` is:
- Count = floor((limit - 1) / n)
- Sum = n × (Count × (Count + 1)) / 2

## Solution

```javascript
function sumMultiples(n, limit) {
    const count = Math.floor((limit - 1) / n);
    return n * count * (count + 1) / 2;
}

function euler001(limit) {
    const sum3 = sumMultiples(3, limit);
    const sum5 = sumMultiples(5, limit);
    const sum15 = sumMultiples(15, limit); // Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5

    // Subtract sum15 because we counted these twice
    return sum3 + sum5 - sum15;
}

console.log(euler001(1000)); // Answer for numbers below 1000
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) - Constant time using mathematical formula
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - No additional space needed

## Explanation

We use the **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**:
- Sum of multiples of 3 or 5 = (Sum of multiples of 3) + (Sum of multiples of 5) - (Sum of multiples of 15)

The subtraction is necessary because numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 15) are counted twice.
